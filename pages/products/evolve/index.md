# Evolve

As your ideas develop, you grown you project portfolio, team and scientific career. You are ready to expand and we got you covered for this next phase of your journey. 

The Evolve package is perfect for research groups that are facing one or more of these challenges:
- manage a project portfolio and several sensitive datasets 
- have several users who should not all have access to all datasets
- are expanding with new projects, data or collaborators

With Evolve your research group gets access to up to 5 trusted research environments, digital labs. Each digital lab is (something technical?). Every user get access to their own, personal Workbench that is set-up with everyone's favorite tools, such as R, RStudio, Python, Matlab and Jupyter Notebooks.

Your digital labs are placed under your own Evolve Data Space.
The data space provides an easy overview over your digital labs, users and resource consumptions.   

## Evolve AI
The Evolve package is a great option for machine learning or AI activities. 

The many options in machine learning or AI depend on various mixed activities that require data storage, computational power and graphical accelerators. Our digital labs are flexible and can be scaled up and down according to your needs. We offer different machines and GPUs that you can combine to fit your preferences.

## Evolve Genetics
HUNT Cloud was born out of the genetic research environment in the HUNT study and we have a long tradition for genetic research.

With your own digital labs, you get to combine computational power for many analyses with the sotrage capacity to both experiment with and archive lage datasets. Our labs are highly flexible and allows you to adapt compute resources for day-to-day activities and then upgrade to larger on-demand machines in analysis intensive periods. 

We work closely with the genetic research environment to make sure HUNT Cloud develops along with your field.

## Evolve Your Field
Most fields encouter data that need protection either due to sensitivity issues, privacy, security or IPRs.

At HUNT Cloud we are eager to support sensitive data explorations from all scientific fields. We have 10 years of experience with providing trusted research environments for health scientists and have always worked closely with scientists to ensure our services always develop according to their needs. 

Reach out to discuss how our digital labs can be of benefit to you.
