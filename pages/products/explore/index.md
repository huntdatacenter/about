The Explore package makes it easy to do hard things

Science is hard and with good reason. You are not diving into the unknown becasue it is easy. Working with sensitive data means entering a land of laws, regulations and agreements; but this is also where scientific progress happens every day. 

Explore is our entry product, perfect for sensitive data explorations that need 1-2 digital labs and limited number of users.

With Explore you get access to trusted research environments, digital labs, where you can store, analyse and collaborate on your data. Through Workbench you have all your favorite tools at hand, such as R, RStudio, Python, Matlab and Jupyter Notebooks.

You are in charge of your compute and storage resources. Our digital labs are flexible and you can scale up and down according to your needs. 

## Workbench
We have developed Workbench to give you easy access to your favorite tools. Each user is automatically set up with their own, personal Workbench. HUNT Workbench enables interactive web-based computing built around Jupyter, with access to applications such as Jupyter Notebook, Python, RStudio, R and Conda. We also support MATLAB and Stata for those that bring their own license.

% brief description of technology in our system, both how labs are set-up/work and the tools, with links to relevant documentation pages. For the people who want to dig deep

## Security and compliance
We believe that trust is the single most valuable asset in data-driven science. We have a wholesome approach to security and compliance with a strong emphasis on third-party verified trust.

% very brief intro to security and compliance approach, main goal is to answer out immediate concerns and provide links to more detailed info

## HUNT Cloud Community
Science is global, and so is the HUNT Cloud community. Our scientists comes from many different countries, they work in a range of different fields, applying many different methods to exiting research questions. We strive to facilitate knowledge flow and sharing within this wonderful community. All users have access to our shared Slack channels and designated Slack channels for just your lab. In addition, you are invited to Labting three times a year. This is a place to meet your peers, discuss and advance the field of sensitive data and co-invent the HUNT Cloud services right along with us. 

## Can I order an Explore lab?
Explore labs belong under a data space owned by an organisation, typically a department or clinic. 

Click here to check if your organisation already have a data space!

The data space is an administrative tool that ensures that the organisation have an overview of their sensitive data, research projects and users with data access. This solution enables the researchers to focus solely on their projects.

If you organisation does not have a data space, let us know and we will help you to get started. (contact button)
