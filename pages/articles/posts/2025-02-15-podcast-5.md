The Nordic Conference on Future Health is a collaboration between the Nordic Society of Human Genetics and Precision Medicine (NSHG-PM) and the Nordic Biobank Network. The 2024 conference was organized by Biobank Norway.

This conference conversation series aims to present perspectives from our Nordic Future Health community. Our apologies for the noticeable background noise. The conversation was recorded on a busy conference floor.

HUNT Cloud at NTNU in Norway develops and delivers digital environments for sensitive data science. Our mission with these conversations is to bring together perspectives that explore the intersections of knowledge, collaboration and creativity to advance knowledge from data.

“In pursuit of knowledge, we need the freedom to explore.”
