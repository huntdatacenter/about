    This is a conversation with Marc Vaudel about running digital research environments for sensitive data.

    Marc Vaudel oversees digital labs from the University of Bergen and Norwegian Institute of Public Health that bring together scientists who use data from large cohorts and health registries in combination with large-scale biomedical data. Here he shares his perspectives on how building a culture that takes good care of the data from research participants is key to long-term scientific success.

The Nordic Conference on Future Health is a collaboration between the Nordic Society of Human Genetics and Precision Medicine (NSHG-PM) and the Nordic Biobank Network. The 2024 conference was organized by Biobank Norway.

This conference conversation series aims to present perspectives from our Nordic Future Health community. Our apologies for the noticeable background noise. The conversation was recorded on a busy conference floor.

HUNT Cloud at NTNU in Norway develops and delivers digital environments for sensitive data science. Our mission with these conversations is to bring together perspectives that explore the intersections of knowledge, collaboration and creativity to advance knowledge from data.

“In pursuit of knowledge, we need the freedom to explore.”
